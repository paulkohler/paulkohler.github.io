Hmmm, an about page.
Not sure I like that idea much!

*My happy face*

That's tongue in cheek for those who don't know me --- I tend to joke around a little...

Professionally I am a developer, been doing it more than 20 years.
I began coding as a very curious 10 year old on a *Dick Smith VZ300* that we bought down the road for $99 (saved from various birthday gifts etc.)

*My first rig*

I had only RAM for the first 6 months while I saved another $60 for a tape recorder... 
Then I could finally save my programs rather than have to type them in each time!

How things have changed over the years. 
I can't wait to see what the next 20 years yield `:)`

I decided to start to blog again recently and also dig up some hidden projects and get them on-line.
A while ago I tore down my old sites that were scattered across the the internet in a bit of a clean-up frenzy.

I will come back and flesh this out sometime `;)`
